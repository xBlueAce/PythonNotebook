# modulo or "Mod" Operator
print(7 / 4) # prints out 1.75

# VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS
# Names cannot start with a number.
# python uses Dynamic typing

# Dynamic typing:
#        you can reassign variables to different data types

my_dog = 2
my_dog = ["Sammy", "frankie"] # This is okay in python!
print(my_dog)

#example
a = 5
print(a)
a = 10
print(a)

print (a + a)
a = a + a
print(type(a)) # lets you know the type of variable

my_income = 100
tax_rate = 0.1
my_taxes = my_income * tax_rate
print("this is my taxes", my_taxes)
print(a)
